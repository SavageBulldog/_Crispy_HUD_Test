### xxx---- Crispy HUD Addon for SidHUD ----xxx

`contains optional addons for`
- SquareDOV 		retexture and text-color-adjustment (blueish clock and static counter)
- AlternativeIcons 	rescaling-patch (to fit with the new HUD/ also compatible with the CY-A HUD by ISayRandomThings)
- CrispyHUD 		enable quickslots and currentammocounter patch


`INSTALLATION:`

for best results use ModOrganizer2 or your prefered mod installer -> fomod
!!! however make sure you load CrispyHUD addons after SidHUD, SquareDOV or AlternativeIcons since any of my patches/addons needs files from these mods !!!
optional addons can be used seperately aswell, they do not require the use of CrispyHUD files

or

manually install the files via classic copy paste to .../anomalydir/gamedata
!!! with this method you have to be careful tho and install the other mods first and then my addons/patches last !!!

---------------

`changes:`

- fixed up and redone elements of CY-A HUD Addon for SidHUD
- ammo counter, weapon health, armor health, rad bar, psy bar, hp, bleeding - adjusted textures
- now you can toggle the items on and off again separately, from MCM menu in SidHUD
- additional patch included to bring back Quickslots and CurrentAmmoCounter(magazine)(install after CrispyHUD main addon)
- simple retexture that fits the minimal HUD style

`optional:`

- retextured SquareDOV	Minimap Mod to fit the new theme
- font-color-adjustment for SquareDOV Minimap Mod, turns the clock and "NPC-counter" under the minimap blue-ish
- rescaling-patch for AlternativeIcons Mod, Buff/Debuff icons downsized to .38 (works for CY-A HUD aswell)

-----------------

highly inspired by [CY-A HUD](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/cy-a-hud)! check it out first before you download my version!


[SidHUD](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/sidhud) needs to be installed first, for this mod to work
- make sure CrispyHUD is loaded after SidHUD !!


[SquareDOV Minimap Mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/squaredov) needs to be installed first, if you want to use the minimap retextures/recolors
- i recommend using this along with the MinimapToggle Addon to keep the game more immersive
- make sure CrispyHUD/Addons is/are loaded after SquareDOV !!

[AlternativeIcons](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-anomaly/addons/alticons) needs to be installed first, if you want to use the rescaling-patch
- you can use any of the colors when installing, i recommend the coloredIcons version
- !! colors and textures and not included in my patch !!
- you must install Alternative Icons first
- make sure this patch is loaded after Alternative Icons !!
